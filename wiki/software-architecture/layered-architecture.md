### Layered (N-Tier) Architecture

**Overview**:  
Layered architecture (also known as N-Tier architecture) is one of the most common architectural patterns used in software design. It organizes the system into distinct layers, where each layer performs a specific role in the system. Typically, the layers interact with each other in a hierarchical manner, meaning that a layer can only communicate with the layer immediately below or above it. This clear separation of concerns makes the system more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

### Common Layers in N-Tier Architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI Layer)**  
   - **Role**: This layer is responsible for handling user interactions. It includes the user interface (UI), which could be a web interface, desktop application, or mobile app. The presentation layer sends user requests to the business logic layer and displays the results.
   - **Example**: In an e-commerce website, the presentation layer would include pages where users can view products, add them to their cart, and place orders.

2. **Business Logic Layer (Application Layer)**  
   - **Role**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes the user input from the presentation layer and applies the necessary business rules, calculations, or processes to fulfill the request. It acts as the "brains" of the application.
   - **Example**: When a user submits an order, the business logic layer checks for stock availability, calculates the total cost, applies discounts, and handles the order validation.

3. **Data Access Layer**  
   - **Role**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any other data storage systems. It provides an interface for the business logic layer to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This separation ensures that business logic does not directly access or manipulate the database.
   - **Example**: In a banking application, when the business logic layer requests account balance information, the data access layer fetches the relevant data from the database.

4. **Database Layer (Data Storage)**  
   - **Role**: This is the actual database where all the application data is stored. It includes relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra). In some cases, external APIs or file storage systems could also be part of this layer.
   - **Example**: In a social media application, user profiles, posts, and comments are stored in the database layer, which is accessed via the data access layer.

### Example of Layered Architecture in an E-commerce Application:

When a user wants to buy a product online, the request follows this path:
1. **Presentation Layer**: The user adds a product to their cart through the web interface.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: The system processes the userâ€™s request to validate the order, check for available inventory, and calculate the final price.
3. **Data Access Layer**: The system retrieves product availability and user account information from the database.
4. **Database Layer**: The product and user data are fetched from the database and sent back through the layers.

### Key Characteristics of Layered Architecture:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a well-defined role and responsibility. For instance, UI development is separate from business logic, and database handling is abstracted from business logic.
  
- **Inter-Layer Communication**: Layers can only interact with adjacent layers. For instance, the presentation layer cannot communicate directly with the database layer; instead, it communicates with the business logic layer.

- **Modularity**: Layers can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, which improves code modularity.

- **Scalability**: By isolating concerns, each layer can be scaled independently. For example, if the system has a high number of read requests, only the database layer can be scaled to handle more queries without touching the other layers.

### Advantages of Layered Architecture:

1. **Maintainability**: Since each layer has a clear responsibility, changes can be made to one layer without impacting the others, making the system easier to maintain.
   
2. **Testability**: Layers can be tested independently. For example, the business logic can be tested without the UI or data access layer.
   
3. **Reusability**: Components in each layer, such as data access services or business logic rules, can be reused across different parts of the application.

4. **Scalability**: The separation of concerns allows scaling of individual layers as needed. For instance, the data access layer can be scaled to handle more database queries without affecting the other layers.

5. **Abstraction**: Each layer abstracts its functionality from the others, promoting decoupling. This allows developers to focus on solving specific problems at each level.

### Disadvantages of Layered Architecture:

1. **Performance Overhead**: The additional layers introduce performance overhead since requests need to pass through multiple layers before reaching their destination. This may slow down the system in high-performance environments.

2. **Tight Coupling**: While each layer is abstracted, tight coupling between layers (such as rigid interfaces between layers) can hinder changes, requiring extensive modifications if a change is needed across multiple layers.

3. **Complexity in Large Systems**: For very large systems, the complexity of maintaining distinct layers and ensuring proper communication between them can be overwhelming.

4. **Over-engineering for Small Applications**: For simple or small applications, this pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity, as layering may not be needed.

### Example in Real-World Applications:
- **Banking Systems**: Most banking applications use layered architecture where user interfaces, business logic (like transaction processing), and database layers are distinct.
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Many e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay use layered architectures to handle their massive scale of transactions, processing, and data management.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Large-scale enterprise systems such as CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems often follow this pattern to organize their codebase and services logically.

### Conclusion:

Layered (N-Tier) architecture is widely used in traditional enterprise systems due to its organized structure and separation of concerns. It is well-suited for systems that require clear divisions of responsibilities, such as large-scale web applications, but it may not always be ideal for real-time or highly performance-driven systems due to the additional overhead involved.
