## 10. Explain the difference between lists and tuples.


### Difference Between Lists and Tuples in Python

1. **Mutability**
   - **Lists:**
     - Mutable: Elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.
     - Example: 
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3]
       my_list[0] = 10  # Changes the first element to 10
       my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end of the list
       ```
   - **Tuples:**
     - Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
       # my_tuple[0] = 10  # Raises a TypeError because tuples are immutable
       ```

2. **Syntax**
   - **Lists:**
     - Defined using square brackets `[]`.
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3]
       ```
   - **Tuples:**
     - Defined using parentheses `()`.
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
       ```

3. **Use Cases**
   - **Lists:**
     - Suitable for collections of items that may change during program execution (e.g., a list of tasks, shopping cart items).
   - **Tuples:**
     - Suitable for fixed collections of items that should not change (e.g., coordinates, database records).

4. **Performance**
   - **Lists:**
     - Slightly slower than tuples due to the overhead of mutability (extra memory required for dynamic resizing).
   - **Tuples:**
     - Faster than lists because they are immutable and have a fixed size, which allows for optimizations.

5. **Memory Usage**
   - **Lists:**
     - Use more memory because they need to store additional data structures to support dynamic resizing.
   - **Tuples:**
     - Use less memory compared to lists because they are immutable and do not require extra space for resizing.

6. **Methods**
   - **Lists:**
     - Provide a variety of built-in methods for modification, such as `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, etc.
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3]
       my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the list
       ```
   - **Tuples:**
     - Have fewer built-in methods, mainly for counting and finding elements (`count()`, `index()`).
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2)
       print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 2
       ```

7. **Slicing and Indexing**
   - **Lists:**
     - Support slicing and indexing, allowing for element access and modification.
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
       print(my_list[1:3])  # Output: [2, 3]
       ```
   - **Tuples:**
     - Also support slicing and indexing, but since they are immutable, you cannot modify elements.
     - Example:
       ```python
       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
       print(my_tuple[1:3])  # Output: (2, 3)
       ```

8. **Use in Dictionaries**
   - **Lists:**
     - Cannot be used as dictionary keys because they are mutable.
   - **Tuples:**
     - Can be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable.

### Summary
- **Lists** are mutable, dynamic, and better suited for collections that need to change over time, whereas **tuples** are immutable, fixed, and are ideal for representing constant data.
- Choose between lists and tuples based on whether the data collection needs to be modified and whether performance is a concern.
