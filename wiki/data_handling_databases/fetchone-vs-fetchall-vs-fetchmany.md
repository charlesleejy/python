## What is the difference between `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, and `fetchmany()`?


In Python, when you execute a query using a cursor object to retrieve data from a database, you can use the `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, and `fetchmany()` methods to retrieve the results. These methods differ in how much data they return from the query results.

### 1. **`fetchone()`**

- **Purpose:** Fetches the next row of the query result set.
- **Returns:** A single tuple representing the next row, or `None` if no more rows are available.
- **Use Case:** Use `fetchone()` when you want to process one row at a time, especially in cases where you're dealing with large datasets, and you don't want to load all the data into memory at once.

**Example:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
row = cursor.fetchone()
print(row)  # Output: ('John', 'Doe', 'Developer', 50000)
```

- **Explanation:** Each call to `fetchone()` retrieves the next row in the result set. If there are no more rows, it returns `None`.

### 2. **`fetchall()`**

- **Purpose:** Fetches all (remaining) rows of the query result set.
- **Returns:** A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the result set. If no rows are available, it returns an empty list.
- **Use Case:** Use `fetchall()` when you are sure that the query result is small enough to fit into memory or when you need all the results at once.

**Example:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
print(rows)
# Output: [('John', 'Doe', 'Developer', 50000), ('Jane', 'Smith', 'Manager', 60000)]
```

- **Explanation:** `fetchall()` retrieves all the rows from the result set as a list of tuples.

### 3. **`fetchmany(size=n)`**

- **Purpose:** Fetches the next `n` rows of the query result set.
- **Returns:** A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the result set. The list will contain at most `n` tuples. If there are fewer than `n` rows remaining, it returns only the remaining rows. If no rows are available, it returns an empty list.
- **Use Case:** Use `fetchmany()` when you want to fetch a specific number of rows at a time, which can be useful for controlling memory usage or processing data in chunks.

**Example:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
rows = cursor.fetchmany(size=2)
print(rows)
# Output: [('John', 'Doe', 'Developer', 50000), ('Jane', 'Smith', 'Manager', 60000)]
```

- **Explanation:** `fetchmany(size=2)` retrieves the next two rows from the result set. If fewer than `2` rows are available, it returns the remaining rows.

### Summary of Differences

1. **`fetchone()`**
   - **Returns:** A single tuple (one row) or `None` if no more rows are available.
   - **Use Case:** When you need to process one row at a time.

2. **`fetchall()`**
   - **Returns:** A list of tuples containing all rows from the query result.
   - **Use Case:** When you want to retrieve and process all rows at once.

3. **`fetchmany(size=n)`**
   - **Returns:** A list of tuples containing up to `n` rows.
   - **Use Case:** When you want to fetch a specific number of rows at a time, useful for handling large result sets in smaller chunks.

### Choosing the Right Method

- Use **`fetchone()`** for processing large datasets row by row.
- Use **`fetchall()`** when the result set is small and can be comfortably loaded into memory.
- Use **`fetchmany()`** when you need to balance between memory usage and processing speed, especially with large datasets.
