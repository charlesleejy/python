## 2. Explain the difference between Python 2 and Python 3.


### Difference Between Python 2 and Python 3

1. **Print Statement vs. Print Function**
   - Python 2: 
     - `print` is a statement. No parentheses required.
     - Example: `print "Hello"`
   - Python 3: 
     - `print` is a function. Parentheses are required.
     - Example: `print("Hello")`

2. **Integer Division**
   - Python 2:
     - Division of two integers results in an integer, truncating the decimal part.
     - Example: `5 / 2` results in `2`.
   - Python 3:
     - Division of two integers returns a float by default.
     - Example: `5 / 2` results in `2.5`.
     - For integer division, use `//`.
     - Example: `5 // 2` results in `2`.

3. **Unicode Support**
   - Python 2:
     - Strings are ASCII by default. Unicode literals require a `u` prefix.
     - Example: `u"Hello"`
   - Python 3:
     - Strings are Unicode by default, supporting a broader range of characters.
     - Example: `"Hello"`

4. **Error Handling**
   - Python 2:
     - The `except` syntax uses a comma between the exception type and the variable.
     - Example: `except ValueError, e:`
   - Python 3:
     - The `except` syntax uses the `as` keyword.
     - Example: `except ValueError as e:`

5. **`xrange()` vs. `range()`**
   - Python 2:
     - `range()` returns a list.
     - `xrange()` returns an iterator for memory efficiency with large ranges.
   - Python 3:
     - `range()` behaves like `xrange()` from Python 2, returning an iterator.
     - `xrange()` has been removed.

6. **Input Function**
   - Python 2:
     - `input()` evaluates the input as a Python expression.
     - `raw_input()` is used to take input as a string.
   - Python 3:
     - `input()` always returns a string.
     - `raw_input()` is removed.

7. **Iteration Over Dictionaries**
   - Python 2:
     - `dict.keys()`, `dict.values()`, and `dict.items()` return lists.
   - Python 3:
     - These methods return views (iterators), which are more memory-efficient and reflect changes to the dictionary in real-time.

8. **Libraries and Compatibility**
   - Python 2:
     - Many libraries were designed for Python 2 and may not be compatible with Python 3.
   - Python 3:
     - Some libraries have been updated for Python 3. Python 3 is not backward-compatible with Python 2.

9. **Metaclass Syntax**
   - Python 2:
     - Metaclasses are defined using `__metaclass__`.
   - Python 3:
     - Uses the `metaclass` keyword directly in the class definition.
     - Example: `class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):`

10. **Support and Maintenance**
    - Python 2:
      - Officially reached its end of life on January 1, 2020. No further updates or support.
    - Python 3:
      - Actively maintained with ongoing updates, improvements, and new features.

### Conclusion
- Python 3 introduces significant improvements and modern features, making it the recommended version for current and future development. The differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are substantial, and Python 3 code is not backward-compatible with Python 2.
