### Difference Between Data Hiding and Abstraction

Both **data hiding** and **abstraction** are important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes. While they are related to how information is managed and accessed, they focus on different aspects of **data protection** and **system design**.

### 1. **Data Hiding**: Protecting Data from External Access

**Data hiding** is the practice of restricting direct access to an object's internal data (attributes) by making certain variables or methods **private** or **protected**. The goal is to **hide the internal implementation details** and ensure that data can only be accessed or modified through well-defined interfaces (such as public methods).

#### Key Characteristics of Data Hiding:
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding is closely tied to encapsulation, where internal state (attributes) of an object is hidden from outside access, providing controlled access via methods.
- **Private and Protected Attributes**: In Python, data hiding is typically achieved by using **naming conventions** such as single underscore (`_`) for protected attributes and double underscore (`__`) for private attributes.
- **Security**: It prevents unintended or unauthorized modifications, ensuring that an object's internal data is not exposed or changed without control.

#### Example of Data Hiding in Python:

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name           # Public attribute
        self._position = "Junior"  # Protected attribute (convention)
        self.__salary = salary     # Private attribute (name mangling)

    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary  # Providing controlled access to private data

    def set_salary(self, salary):
        if salary > 0:
            self.__salary = salary  # Validating data before updating

emp = Employee("Alice", 5000)
print(emp.name)           # Output: Alice (public attribute)
print(emp._position)      # Output: Junior (accessible but conventionally "protected")
# print(emp.__salary)     # Error: AttributeError due to name mangling
print(emp.get_salary())   # Output: 5000 (accessing private data via method)
```

**Key Points about Data Hiding**:
- **Direct access to sensitive data is restricted**: In the example above, `__salary` is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, controlled access is provided through `get_salary()` and `set_salary()` methods.
- **Purpose**: The main goal of data hiding is to **protect data** and ensure that it is modified only in valid ways.

### 2. **Abstraction**: Simplifying Complex Systems by Hiding Implementation Details

**Abstraction** refers to the concept of hiding **implementation details** and exposing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on **simplifying complex systems** by providing a high-level interface that users can interact with, without needing to understand how the object or system works internally.

#### Key Characteristics of Abstraction:
- **Simplified Interface**: Abstraction provides a clean and easy-to-use interface, hiding the complexities of the internal workings.
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: In OOP, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. In Python, abstract classes are created using the `ABC` module (Abstract Base Classes), where certain methods must be implemented by subclasses.
- **Focus on "What" Rather Than "How"**: Abstraction emphasizes **what** an object can do rather than **how** it performs its functions. This allows users to work with objects without knowing the underlying implementation details.

#### Example of Abstraction in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class
class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def stop(self):
        pass

# Concrete class implementing the abstract methods
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car engine started")

    def stop(self):
        print("Car engine stopped")

# Using abstraction
car = Car()
car.start()  # Output: Car engine started
car.stop()   # Output: Car engine stopped
```

**Key Points about Abstraction**:
- **The "What" is exposed, the "How" is hidden**: In this example, the `Vehicle` class defines **what** actions (start and stop) should be performed, but **how** those actions are carried out is left to the subclass (`Car`). The user of the `Car` object does not need to know how the engine starts; they only interact with the high-level method `start()`.
- **Simplified Interaction**: Users interact with a simplified interface (methods like `start()` and `stop()`) and do not need to worry about the underlying mechanics of how those actions are performed.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Protecting internal data from unauthorized access    | Hiding implementation details and providing a simplified interface |
| **Goal**                  | Preventing direct access to internal data, ensuring data integrity | Simplifying complex systems by exposing only essential features |
| **Implementation**        | Achieved through private/protected attributes and controlled access via methods | Achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, and high-level methods |
| **Visibility**            | Hides specific attributes or methods from external access | Hides internal implementation details while exposing functionality |
| **Example**               | Making an attribute private or protected             | Using abstract classes or interfaces to define essential functionality |
| **Control**               | Provides controlled access to internal data          | Provides a high-level view of functionality without exposing the details |
| **Use Case**              | Protecting sensitive information like passwords, salary, etc. | Designing a high-level interface for users to interact with a complex system |

### Summary:

1. **Data Hiding**:
   - **Purpose**: Restrict access to an object's internal state and protect sensitive information by allowing access only through controlled methods.
   - **How**: It is implemented using private or protected attributes and methods, providing access through getter and setter methods. The focus is on ensuring data security and integrity.
   - **Example**: Using `__salary` as a private attribute that can only be accessed or modified through methods.

2. **Abstraction**:
   - **Purpose**: Simplify the complexity of a system by providing a clear, high-level interface that hides unnecessary details.
   - **How**: It is implemented using abstract classes, interfaces, or methods that provide essential functionality without exposing the internal workings. The focus is on providing a simple, user-friendly interaction.
   - **Example**: Defining an abstract `Vehicle` class with high-level methods like `start()` and `stop()` without revealing how the vehicle operates internally.

**In summary**, **data hiding** is about **controlling access** to an object's data, while **abstraction** is about **simplifying complex systems** by exposing only the necessary parts and hiding the internal details. Both concepts work together to create well-structured, secure, and easy-to-use object-oriented systems.
