### Explanation of `staticmethod` and `classmethod` in Python

In Python, `staticmethod` and `classmethod` are two important decorators that allow methods to be defined in a class but not bound to instances in the typical way. These methods can be called on the class itself rather than on an instance of the class. Understanding when and how to use them properly can make your code cleaner, more organized, and aligned with object-oriented principles.

### 1. **`staticmethod`: Static Methods in Python**

A `staticmethod` is a method that doesn't depend on class or instance variables (like `self` for an instance or `cls` for a class). It behaves like a regular function, but it is included within a class's namespace, which makes it logically related to the class.

#### Characteristics of `staticmethod`:
- It does **not** receive an implicit first argument (`self` or `cls`).
- It **cannot modify** the object instance or class variables.
- It is used for utility functions that have some logical connection to the class but don't need access to its state.

#### When to Use `staticmethod`:
- Use a static method when the method doesn’t need to know or modify the class or instance's state.
- Group functions together that logically belong to a class but don’t need to modify or read class/instance data.

#### Example:

```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b

# Usage
print(MathOperations.add(5, 3))       # Output: 8
print(MathOperations.multiply(5, 3))  # Output: 15
```

**Explanation**:
- The `add` and `multiply` methods belong to `MathOperations` because they are mathematically related, but they don’t need access to any class or instance variables.
- These methods are simply called using the class name (`MathOperations.add()`) because they are not bound to an instance of the class.

#### Practical Use Case for `staticmethod`:
Let’s say you have a class that represents a `Circle`, and you need a utility function to calculate the area or circumference based on a radius without needing an instance of `Circle`.

```python
import math

class Circle:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_area(radius):
        return math.pi * (radius ** 2)

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_circumference(radius):
        return 2 * math.pi * radius

# Usage
print(Circle.calculate_area(5))  # Output: 78.53981633974483
print(Circle.calculate_circumference(5))  # Output: 31.41592653589793
```

**Explanation**:
- You can call these static methods using the class name, as they don’t require an instance of `Circle`. They simply perform calculations based on the input `radius`.

### 2. **`classmethod`: Class Methods in Python**

A `classmethod` is a method that receives the class as its first argument, typically named `cls`. This means that the method operates on the class itself, and it can access and modify class variables or call other class methods. `classmethod` is most commonly used for **factory methods** that return instances of the class, but it can also modify class-level data.

#### Characteristics of `classmethod`:
- It **receives the class** (`cls`) as the first argument instead of an instance (`self`).
- It can **modify class variables** and can be used to create alternative constructors (factory methods).
- It can be called either on the class itself or on an instance of the class.

#### When to Use `classmethod`:
- When you need to modify class-level data that applies across all instances of the class.
- When you need to define **alternative constructors** that return an instance of the class based on certain input.

#### Example 1: Modifying Class Attributes

```python
class Employee:
    raise_percentage = 1.05  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    @classmethod
    def set_raise_percentage(cls, percentage):
        cls.raise_percentage = percentage  # Modifies class attribute

    def apply_raise(self):
        self.salary *= self.raise_percentage

# Usage
Employee.set_raise_percentage(1.10)  # Modify class attribute for all instances

emp1 = Employee('John', 50000)
emp2 = Employee('Jane', 60000)

emp1.apply_raise()
emp2.apply_raise()

print(emp1.salary)  # Output: 55000.0
print(emp2.salary)  # Output: 66000.0
```

**Explanation**:
- `set_raise_percentage` is a `classmethod` that modifies the class-level attribute `raise_percentage`.
- When we call `Employee.set_raise_percentage(1.10)`, the raise percentage is updated for **all instances** of the class, not just one.

#### Example 2: Creating Alternative Constructors

A `classmethod` can also be used as a **factory method**, allowing you to create instances of the class in a different way.

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, employee_string):
        name, salary = employee_string.split('-')
        return cls(name, float(salary))

# Usage
emp1 = Employee('Alice', 70000)
emp2 = Employee.from_string('Bob-80000')  # Create an instance using class method

print(emp1.name, emp1.salary)  # Output: Alice 70000
print(emp2.name, emp2.salary)  # Output: Bob 80000
```

**Explanation**:
- The `from_string` method is a `classmethod` that provides an alternative way of creating an `Employee` instance by parsing a string.
- It returns a new instance of `Employee` by calling the `cls()` constructor, which refers to the class (`Employee`).

### Key Differences Between `staticmethod` and `classmethod`

| **Feature**                      | **`staticmethod`**                                 | **`classmethod`**                                  |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **First Argument**                | No automatic first argument (`self` or `cls`).    | Receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument. |
| **Access to Class/Instance State**| Cannot access class or instance attributes.       | Can access and modify class attributes but not instance attributes. |
| **Typical Usage**                 | For utility functions that don’t need access to class or instance variables. | For factory methods, or methods that need to modify class-level data. |
| **Call Context**                  | Can be called on the class or an instance.        | Can be called on the class or an instance.        |

### Further Example: Using Both `staticmethod` and `classmethod` in the Same Class

```python
class Vehicle:
    total_vehicles = 0

    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        Vehicle.total_vehicles += 1

    @staticmethod
    def is_motor_vehicle(vehicle_type):
        motor_vehicles = ['car', 'truck', 'motorbike']
        return vehicle_type in motor_vehicles

    @classmethod
    def set_total_vehicles(cls, count):
        cls.total_vehicles = count

# Static method usage
print(Vehicle.is_motor_vehicle('bicycle'))  # Output: False
print(Vehicle.is_motor_vehicle('car'))      # Output: True

# Class method usage
Vehicle.set_total_vehicles(10)
print(Vehicle.total_vehicles)  # Output: 10
```

**Explanation**:
- The static method `is_motor_vehicle` checks whether a given vehicle type is a motor vehicle or not. It doesn’t need to access class or instance data.
- The class method `set_total_vehicles` modifies the class-level attribute `total_vehicles`, affecting all instances of the `Vehicle` class.

### Conclusion

- **`staticmethod`:** Use it when you want to define a method that belongs to a class logically but doesn’t need access to the class or instance state. It behaves like a regular function but is called using the class.
- **`classmethod`:** Use it when you want to define a method that operates on the class itself (via the `cls` argument) and can modify class-level attributes. It is commonly used for factory methods or for modifying class-wide state.

Understanding when to use each of these decorators can help you structure your code more effectively, making it cleaner, more maintainable, and better organized.
