### What is an Abstract Method?

An **abstract method** is a method that is declared in a class but **does not have an implementation** in that class. It is intended to be **overridden** by subclasses that inherit from the class containing the abstract method. In essence, an abstract method sets a contract or blueprint for the subclasses, ensuring they provide their own specific implementation of the method.

Abstract methods are typically used in the context of **abstract classes** or **interfaces** to define methods that must be implemented by derived classes. These methods are **purely declarative** in nature, meaning the base class only declares the method signature but leaves its implementation to the subclasses.

In Python, abstract methods are defined using the `@abstractmethod` decorator from the **abc** module (Abstract Base Classes).

### Characteristics of an Abstract Method

1. **No implementation**: Abstract methods only contain a declaration, not the method body or implementation.
2. **Subclass responsibility**: Any subclass that inherits from a class with abstract methods must implement the abstract method, or else the subclass itself will be considered abstract and cannot be instantiated.
3. **Cannot instantiate abstract classes**: A class containing abstract methods (an abstract class) cannot be instantiated directly. Only its subclasses can be instantiated after they implement the required abstract methods.

### Abstract Method in Python

In Python, to create an abstract method, you must:

1. Import the `abc` module.
2. Define the abstract method using the `@abstractmethod` decorator.
3. Use an abstract class as the base class (decorated with `ABC` from `abc`).

#### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class (cannot be instantiated)
class Animal(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        """Abstract method: must be implemented in subclasses"""
        pass

# Concrete subclass
class Dog(Animal):
    
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Using the subclasses
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.sound())  # Output: Woof!
print(cat.sound())  # Output: Meow!

# animal = Animal()  # This would raise an error because Animal has abstract methods
```

#### Explanation:
- **`Animal(ABC)`**: This is an abstract class because it inherits from `ABC`, which means it can contain abstract methods.
- **`@abstractmethod`**: The `sound` method in the `Animal` class is declared as abstract, meaning subclasses (like `Dog` and `Cat`) must provide their own implementation.
- **Subclasses (`Dog`, `Cat`)**: Both `Dog` and `Cat` provide concrete implementations of the `sound` method.

### Benefits of Using Abstract Methods

1. **Enforces structure**: Abstract methods ensure that all subclasses provide a specific implementation of a method, maintaining a consistent interface across different implementations.
2. **Code reuse**: Abstract classes can provide shared functionality, while abstract methods ensure that subclass-specific behavior is implemented.
3. **Encourages inheritance**: By defining abstract methods in a base class, you encourage subclassing and promote the use of inheritance in object-oriented design.

---

### Key Points:
- An **abstract method** is a method that **must be implemented** by any subclass that inherits the abstract class.
- Abstract methods are declared with the `@abstractmethod` decorator in Python.
- **Abstract classes** (which contain abstract methods) cannot be instantiated, and they serve as templates for other classes to implement the abstract methods.

### Conclusion

Abstract methods are fundamental in object-oriented programming when designing **base classes** that provide a framework or contract for subclasses. They define a common interface and force subclasses to implement their own behavior, making your code more structured and easier to maintain. By using abstract methods, you ensure that subclasses fulfill their obligations and conform to the design of the parent class.
