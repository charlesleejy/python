## 76. How do you handle debugging in Python?


Debugging is an essential part of software development, and Python provides several tools and techniques to help identify and fix issues in your code. Hereâ€™s how you can handle debugging in Python:

### 1. **Using Print Statements**

The simplest way to debug a Python program is to insert `print()` statements at various points in your code to display the values of variables and the flow of execution.

**Example:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    print(f"Adding {a} and {b}")
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

- **Explanation:** This technique is straightforward but can become cumbersome for larger or more complex programs.

### 2. **Using the `pdb` Module (Python Debugger)**

Python includes a built-in interactive debugger called `pdb`. You can use `pdb` to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code interactively.

**Example:**

```python
import pdb

def divide(a, b):
    pdb.set_trace()  # Start the debugger here
    return a / b

result = divide(10, 0)
print(result)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `pdb.set_trace()`: Starts the debugger at the line where it is called. When the code reaches this point, execution stops, and you can inspect the state of your program.
  - Inside the `pdb` prompt, you can use commands like `n` (next line), `s` (step into), `c` (continue execution), `p` (print variable), and `q` (quit the debugger).

### 3. **Using `breakpoint()`**

Starting from Python 3.7, you can use the built-in `breakpoint()` function to enter the debugger. This is a simpler and more modern alternative to `pdb.set_trace()`.

**Example:**

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    breakpoint()  # Enters the debugger
    return a * b

result = multiply(2, 3)
print(result)
```

- **Explanation:** `breakpoint()` launches the default debugger (`pdb` by default) at the line where it is called.

### 4. **Using IDE Debuggers**

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like PyCharm, VS Code, and others come with powerful graphical debuggers. These tools allow you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and control the flow of your program without needing to insert `print()` statements or use `pdb`.

- **Setting Breakpoints:** Click in the margin next to the line number in your IDE to set a breakpoint.
- **Running in Debug Mode:** Start the program in debug mode. The execution will pause at the breakpoints, allowing you to inspect the state of the program.

### 5. **Using Logging**

For more complex applications, replacing `print()` statements with the `logging` module provides more flexibility and control. The `logging` module supports different levels of severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and can be configured to write logs to files.

**Example:**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def add(a, b):
    logging.debug(f"Adding {a} and {b}")
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
logging.info(f"Result: {result}")
```

- **Explanation:** This approach allows you to control the verbosity of output and easily switch between different levels of logging for development and production.

### 6. **Using Stack Traces**

When an exception occurs, Python provides a stack trace that shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error. Understanding stack traces is essential for debugging.

**Example:**

```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

def calculate():
    return divide(10, 0)

calculate()
```

- **Explanation:** Running this code will produce a `ZeroDivisionError` with a stack trace showing that the error originated in the `divide` function, called by `calculate`.

### 7. **Using Assertions**

Assertions can help catch bugs by verifying that conditions hold true at specific points in your code. Use `assert` statements during development to make assumptions explicit.

**Example:**

```python
def square_root(x):
    assert x >= 0, "x must be non-negative"
    return x ** 0.5
```

- **Explanation:** If `x` is negative, the program will raise an `AssertionError` with the provided message.

### 8. **Using Try/Except Blocks**

Exception handling allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully, which can be useful for debugging unexpected issues.

**Example:**

```python
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

result = divide(10, 0)
```

- **Explanation:** The `try` block runs the code, and if a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, the `except` block catches the error and handles it.

### Summary

- **Print Statements:** Simple but effective for small tasks.
- **`pdb` Module:** Powerful, built-in interactive debugger for stepping through code.
- **`breakpoint()` Function:** A modern and convenient way to start debugging.
- **IDE Debuggers:** Visual, user-friendly debugging in tools like PyCharm and VS Code.
- **Logging:** Use the `logging` module for more control and less intrusive debugging.
- **Stack Traces:** Analyze errors and understand the flow of execution when exceptions occur.
- **Assertions:** Validate assumptions in your code.
- **Try/Except Blocks:** Catch and handle exceptions to prevent crashes.

By combining these tools and techniques, you can effectively debug Python code and resolve issues quickly.
