## 90. How do you schedule tasks using `Celery` or `APScheduler`?


Scheduling tasks in Python can be efficiently handled using libraries like `Celery` and `APScheduler`. These tools allow you to run tasks asynchronously and schedule them to run at specific intervals or times. Below is a guide on how to use both `Celery` and `APScheduler` for scheduling tasks.

### 1. **Using `Celery` for Task Scheduling**

`Celery` is an asynchronous task queue/job queue that is focused on real-time operation but also supports scheduling tasks.

#### **Step 1: Install Celery**

Install `Celery` and a message broker like `Redis` (you can use others like RabbitMQ):

```bash
pip install celery[redis]
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up a Celery Application**

Create a `celery.py` file in your project directory:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

app.conf.beat_schedule = {
    'add-every-30-seconds': {
        'task': 'tasks.add',
        'schedule': 30.0,
        'args': (16, 16)
    },
}
app.conf.timezone = 'UTC'
```

#### **Step 3: Define Tasks**

Create a `tasks.py` file to define the tasks that `Celery` will manage:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

#### **Step 4: Run Celery Worker and Beat**

Start the Celery worker to listen for tasks:

```bash
celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

Start Celery Beat, which schedules tasks:

```bash
celery -A tasks beat --loglevel=info
```

#### **Explanation:**

- **`Celery` Worker:** Processes tasks as they are sent to the queue.
- **`Celery` Beat:** Periodically sends tasks to the worker based on the schedule you define.

### 2. **Using `APScheduler` for Task Scheduling**

`APScheduler` (Advanced Python Scheduler) is a lightweight, in-process task scheduler that allows you to schedule Python code to be executed at specific intervals or at a specific time.

#### **Step 1: Install APScheduler**

Install `APScheduler`:

```bash
pip install apscheduler
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up a Scheduler**

Here is a basic example of how to set up `APScheduler`:

```python
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
from apscheduler.triggers.interval import IntervalTrigger
import time

def job():
    print("Task executed")

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
scheduler.start()

# Schedule a task to run every 10 seconds
scheduler.add_job(job, trigger=IntervalTrigger(seconds=10))

try:
    # Keep the script running
    while True:
        time.sleep(2)
except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
    scheduler.shutdown()
```

#### **Explanation:**

- **`BackgroundScheduler`:** Runs the scheduler in the background, allowing the main application to continue running.
- **`IntervalTrigger`:** Schedules the job to run at specific intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds).

#### **Step 3: Advanced Scheduling with APScheduler**

You can also use different types of triggers:

- **Date-based Trigger:** Run a task at a specific date and time.
  ```python
  from apscheduler.triggers.date import DateTrigger
  from datetime import datetime

  scheduler.add_job(job, trigger=DateTrigger(run_date=datetime(2024, 8, 19, 12, 0)))
  ```

- **Cron-based Trigger:** Run tasks on a schedule similar to cron jobs.
  ```python
  from apscheduler.triggers.cron import CronTrigger

  scheduler.add_job(job, trigger=CronTrigger(day_of_week='mon-fri', hour=12, minute=0))
  ```

#### **Step 4: Run and Monitor the Scheduler**

You can start the scheduler with the `.start()` method and monitor its execution as shown in the earlier example. The scheduler will run the tasks at the specified intervals or times until you stop the script.

### 3. **Choosing Between `Celery` and `APScheduler`**

- **`Celery`:**
  - **Best for:** Distributed task queues, handling large-scale asynchronous tasks, and task scheduling in applications requiring high reliability and scalability.
  - **Strengths:** Robust task management, support for complex workflows, multiple workers, and integration with various message brokers.

- **`APScheduler`:**
  - **Best for:** In-process task scheduling within a single application, lightweight and easy to integrate into existing applications.
  - **Strengths:** Simplicity, no need for an external message broker, ideal for periodic tasks in smaller or standalone applications.

### Summary

- **Celery:** Ideal for large-scale, distributed task scheduling, with the ability to handle complex workflows and retries using a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ.
- **APScheduler:** Best suited for lightweight, in-process task scheduling without the need for external dependencies, making it perfect for small to medium-sized applications.

Both tools are powerful, but they serve different use cases. Choose `Celery` for distributed systems and `APScheduler` for simpler, local scheduling needs.
